# Automated-Data-Scraping-and-Extraction-with-SeleniumThis Python script leverages the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to automate the login process on the Apollo.io platform, a sales engagement tool. The script navigates to the login page, enters the provided email and password, logs in, and then extracts data from the resulting page. It ensures compatibility by dynamically downloading the appropriate ChromeDriver version and demonstrates headless browsing for unobtrusive automation. The project provides a foundation for web scraping and can be extended for various data extraction needs.
